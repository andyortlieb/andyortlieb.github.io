    <h1>The Technological Biography for Andy Ortlieb</h1>

    <h2>Growing Up</h2>

    <div class="bio-section">
        <p>
            I started tinkering with computers and their peripherals once I was
        given my first computer in 1989. Since then I was always intrigued by
        how they worked, why they were useful, and how they could be modified.
        </p>

        <details><summary>The Apple IIc+... 1989-1996</summary>
        <p>
            As a young child I was given my first computer in 1989, an Apple IIc+
        with a <i>Color</i> Apple Monitor II and a <i>Color</i> ImageWriter II!
        Growing up in a household that didn't have much money, coupled with the fact
        that that particular Apple model was a bit of a flop, there wasn't much for
        me to do with it besides figure out how it worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            So it became a mild interest and hobby of mine to explore every reach of
        every mundane piece of software that we could stuff into the diskette box.
        It didn't take long for me to start making sense of the user manuals and
        other documentation that the machine came with. Eventually I started making
        sense of Applesoft BASIC, especially with the help of library books that had 
        program printouts in them. I was touch typing by the fifth grade and 
        </p>

        <details><summary>The Packard Bell Windows 95 PC 1996-2000</summary>
        <p>
            In 1996 we would finally modernize our computer desk with a Packard Bell.
        This particular machine came with some bizarre alternative GUI shell called
        "navigator", which immediately taught me that we do not <i>have</i> to be
        satisfied with the software & configurations that manufacturers set is up
        with, because that thing was goofy as all get out. From here it wouldn't be
        long before I rediscovered my infatuation for systems like I did several
        years earlier with the Apple II. 
        </p>
        </details>

        <details><summary>Networking 1996-</summary>
        <p>
            Having a computer that came with a 28.8 Kbps modem, and a never ending
        stream of free trial floppy disks from a variety of competing nanny-state
        Internet Service Providers, I had an opportunity to learn how to create
        websites, meet new people from far away with similar interests, discovering
        the RFC's, and loads of texts published ad-hoc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally the trial periods would run dry, or connectivity would just
        not be in the family budget. These were the times when I would join forces
        with my cousin to figure out how to make our computers talk to eachother
        over the phone without requiring money. This would prove to lead to more
        interest in connectivity, how it works, and what can be done with it.
        </p>
        </details>

        <details><summary>Programming 1996-</summary>
        <p>
            Besides tinkering with Apple BASIC, I had an opportunity to learn
        Pascal (Borland TurboPascal) with the help of my Uncle, a chemical
        engineer who used it for his calculations and simulations. As a tween I 
        couldn't find too much use for it except to make simple trivia games
        for bands that I liked at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            After becoming connected online, however, I discovered the potential
        usefulness for code in the form of IRC scripts, manipulation of client
        software for certain internet service providers, as well as simple tools
        to keep my computer organized.
        </p>
        </details>

        <details><summary>Multimedia 1996-</summary>
        <p>
            It didn't take much exploring to discover the sndrec32.exe and
        to have the realization that there must also be better software for
        recording. This prompted me to learn how to create multi-track
        musical recordings of myself playing various instruments, as well as 
        composition with MIDI.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I wasn't privy to any contemporary design disciplines, my
        teenage self would be sure to create the edgiest of geocities websites 
        backdropped by wavy magenta tesselations with animated borders hand-drawn
        frame-by-frame and pixel-by-pixel (and no, I am not bragging).
        </p>
        </details>

        <details><summary>Linux 1997-</summary>
        <p>
            At some point I became convinced by people and text files that a
        UNIX operating system was necessary in order to interact with and fully
        understand things that I was becoming interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started playing with a free shell account on SDF (Lonestar.org)
        to learn my way around the shell. But it never felt like it belonged to
        me (and I had a hard time understanding why they were letting me use their
        computer), so I decided I had to figure out how to set up my own box.
        </p>
        </p> I, a person with an x86 machine of course had to figure out how to 
        run Linux all on my own. I discovered the book "Slackware 96 Unleashed",
        which helped me get installed on a shared partition with Windows using
        the "Umsdos" filesystem. While it was a struggle to get it online with
        my skillset at the time, I did eventually manage to play a graphical
        Asteroids clone, and run the GIMP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Between 2000 through 2006 I would toggle between Windows and Linux
        as my daily driver for weeks or months at a time, which would take me to
        an extreme love-hate relationship with open source software. After 2006
        I would not run Windows on my machines at home again until around 2017.

    <h3>Career</h3>

    <p>See Also: <a href="./Commercial-Products.html">Commercial Products</a></p>

    <p>
        I began my career in technology around 2005, when I started a
    data-imaging position for a local medical billing firm. From there, I was
    almost immediately promoted to a systems administrator position after 
    suggesting and implementing a number of process changes that would
    streamline throughput and increase accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this position I learned how to manage Active Directory, Disaster
    Recovery, Linux and SCO UNIX systems, and websites with SSL. I also administered
    plenty of industry specific software packages. The need to develop new systems
    to interact with clients and partners showed up pretty quickly as I developed
    customer portals and automation systems, and learned how to use relational
    databases.
