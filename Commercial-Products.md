#### My Role

My team designed and implemented concise solutions to the entire complex user lifecycle:

 * Loading in standard-issue appraisal forms and automatically processing their contents
 * Graphically designing rules that encompas one or many fields, including complex conditionals and branch evaluation, which can also result in templated advisory messages, and conditionally flag the document for manual review.
 * Templating sets of rules for easy re-use.
 * Effectively and quickly guiding the user through the manual review process, which can possess hundreds to thousands of data points, and doing so by developing a technologically high-performance web-based GUI which was able to operate on browsers as old as IE7.
 * Graphical tools for debugging and analyzing the rules evaluated by the rule engine.
